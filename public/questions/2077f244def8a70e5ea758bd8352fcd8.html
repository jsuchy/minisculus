<h1>CHALLENGE 2</h1>

<p>The SSPA has had another success!  During a raid on a captured communication outpost in Prague, an updated version of the encoding machine has been obtained.  The MARK II has a design evolved from the MARK I in that it still has a letter shifting first wheel, however, a second wheel has been added to further complicate the encoded message.  The MARK II's second wheel is set the same way as the first, e.g. a 0-9 setting.  The difference is that the second wheel shifts the characters in a REVERSE direction TWO TIMES the number shown on the wheel's setting.  This means, a MARK II machine with wheel settings of 2 [First Wheel], 5 [Second Wheel] and input characters of 'abc' will result in an output of 'STU'</p>

<p>Your task is to update your machine to add the second wheel.  Make haste!  Our fascist fighters are relying on you!</p>

<p>JSON question... using the wheel settings of 9,3 what would the encoded message be for the input 'The Desert Fox will move 30 tanks to Calais at dawn'?</p>
