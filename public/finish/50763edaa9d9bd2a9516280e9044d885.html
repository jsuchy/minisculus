       <h1>YOUR FINAL CHALLENGE</h1>

       <p>We have taken the main city of FURLIN (known for it's rich history of fur trading).  Our troops are hunting the enemy high command.  We know that they are hiding in a BUNKER in a remote part of the city.</p>

       <p>We have successfully reproduced the MARK IV machine, however we do not know what today's wheel settings are.  Therefore, we need to use our machine to crack though an encoded message we received today to find the wheel positions.</p>

       <p>JSON QUESTION... The encoded message is in the code attribute of the JSON data. The message contains clue words found in the above text. Once decrypted, what is the decoded message and what are the wheel positions?  (extra points are given for finding all the possible wheel positions that will successfully decode this message).</p>

       <p>Email <a href="mailto:jim@8thlight.com">jim@8thlight.com</a> with your answer, along with public access to your code repository</p>
       <p>Thanks for playing the 8LU Minisculus Challenge!</p>
